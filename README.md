This MATLAB demo generates the results contained in the paper:

Ricardo Augusto Borsoi, Guilherme Holsbach Costa, Jos√© Carlos Moreira Bermudez, "A New Adaptive Video Super-Resolution Algorithm with Improved Robustness to Innovations", IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2018


This demo uses pieces of code provided by different authors. Atribution can be found in the respective codes.


To execute the demo, the low-resolution image sequence must be saved as an array named "frames_LR", of dimensions height * width * frames, in a .mat file. The file name/path is specified as a string at the beginning of the main.m file.
